  <p>This website is going to be mainly for results of my statistical analysis of sports.</p>

  <p>Some of the sports I plan to analyze include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>college basketball (both men's and women's)</li>
    <li>NFL</li>
    <li>NBA</li>
    <li>tennis</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, the primary purpose for this site is to learn and practice web-development. I will be following along with
    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Learn web development</a> tutorials found at the
    Mozilla
    Developer Network web docs.</p>
